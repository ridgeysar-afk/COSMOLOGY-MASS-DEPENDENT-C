Turtle-Verse Cosmology: Mass-Dependent Speed of Light
This repository contains the unified Turtle-Verse framework, merging:

Mass-Dependent Speed of Light — 
𝑐
∝
𝑀
c∝
M
	​

, where 
𝑀
M is the total mass-energy of a universe.

Zero-Point Time (ZPT) — a quantum information vacuum that seeds each universe’s causal structure.

Entropy as Gravity — entanglement entropy drives curvature and cosmic dynamics.

Emergent Grand Unification — unification scales vary across universes, breaking the “one-size-fits-all” assumption.

Cyclic Cosmology — primordial black hole (PBH) pair annihilations trigger universe resets.

The repo includes the arXiv-ready paper, engineering appendices, and the Turtle Reality Generator app (Python/Streamlit) for interactive exploration.
